Din-Rail-Adapter Board for ESP32-Dev-Boards. There are many Dev-Boards available - so please check out if the pin-out matches.
The adapter-board fits in an H-Tronic HUT-6C-casing. Be aware that the current version needs some trimming on the edges, so that it fits exactly into the case.
An upcoming version should fix this issue.
